# CSIDAssist

**A Dietary Support Application for Individuals with Congenital Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency (CSID)**

## Overview
CSIDAssist is an iOS application designed to support individuals suffering from Congenital Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency (CSID), a rare genetic disorder that affects carbohydrate digestion. The app serves as a dietary resource, offering tools to help users navigate their specific dietary restrictions with ease and confidence.

This project highlights my skills as a self-taught iOS developer, including my ability to design, build, and enhance mobile applications that address real-world problems. CSIDAssist demonstrates a commitment to creating tools that make a positive impact on underserved communities.
